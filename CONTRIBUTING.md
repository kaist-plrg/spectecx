# Contributing

This guide is the source of truth for how to contribute to SpecTec-Core. It is read by both human contributors and AI coding agents, so conventions are stated with the reasoning behind them — not just the rule.

For project orientation, build, and run instructions, see [README.md](README.md). This guide assumes you can build the project and run the test suite.

A few `make` targets matter mostly to contributors:

- `make fmt` — runs `dune fmt`. Run before committing.
- `make fmt-check` — runs `dune build @fmt`; fails if anything is unformatted. CI runs the same check.
- `make check` — runs `dune build @check`: type-checks every library and executable without producing the final binary. Faster than `make exe` for catching type errors during iteration.
- `make test-quick` — elaboration and structuring only; a fast inner loop while iterating.
- `make promote` — regenerates `.expected` files. The test suite is diff-based, so a spec or interpreter change that shifts output requires this before the commit lands, otherwise `make test` is red.

## Code Conventions

**Names are part of the spec.** SpecTec-Core is a language-specification compiler; names are vocabulary, not decoration. A misleading name is a semantic bug, not a style nit. Before settling on a name, check it against existing usage sites for the same concept, and prefer a name that communicates *responsibility*, not mechanism. Sweep all usage sites when renaming.

OCaml conventions: `snake_case` for values and types, `PascalCase` for modules and constructors.

**Don't let naming get ahead of architecture.** Rename only once the code has earned the new name. If the boundary or responsibility behind the name isn't yet right, fix that first.

**No backward-compatibility aliases during refactors.** A rename worth doing is worth completing. Transitional names accumulate.

**Prefer self-documenting code over comments.** Before writing a comment, ask whether a clearer name, a smaller function, or a tighter type makes it unnecessary. Comments that survive that test capture what the code genuinely can't: a non-obvious choice taken over the obvious alternative, an invariant relied on but not visible locally, the spec rule being implemented. Comments that paraphrase the next line, restate a function name, or mark sections do not survive.

**Public APIs reflect the final semantic model.** Internal module paths can differ when dependency direction forces it, but the user-facing surface should preserve the clearest ownership story.

**Boundary between `lib/` and `bin/`.** Reusable code — domain presentation, CLI infrastructure, error rendering — lives in `lib/`. CLI machinery specifically lives in `lib/cli/` so targets can instantiate it. `bin/` holds only the top-level entrypoint that registers each target's `Cli` module into the command group and dispatches to `Command_unix.run`. New logic should land in `lib/`, not `bin/`.

**Prefer explicit organization over umbrella buckets** like `core` once distinct concerns have separated.

**Don't introduce one-off meta-patterns** unless they clearly pay for themselves. Small local duplication beats a bespoke helper used nowhere else.

**Use `with_*` only for true scoped wrappers** that run a callback under setup/teardown. When a helper is fundamentally an accumulator update, prefer accumulator-first parameter order to match `fold_left` style.

**Prefer direct code over clever abstractions** when exception handling is involved.

**Prefer small local recursion or folds over mutable refs** when they make control flow easier to read.

**Use `@@` only when it clearly reduces indentation** around a single callback body.

## Why these conventions

Three values drive the workflow rules below: **bisectability**, **reviewability**, and **provenance**. Most specific rules trace back to one of these.

*Bisectability* — `git bisect` should land on a small, buildable, single-purpose commit. That requires three things: every commit builds (otherwise bisect stalls on a non-buildable revision), commits are grouped into merge bubbles (so bisect can step over a whole PR when it isn't the culprit), and refactors stay separate from fixes and features (so the commit bisect lands on isn't doing two things at once).

*Reviewability* is the counterweight. Bisect alone would push toward ever-smaller commits, but the reviewer needs the changes to add up to a coherent story. This is why:

- we don't introduce stubs solely to keep the build green (noise to the reader);
- every non-trivial commit names its motivation;
- PRs are organized around one arc rather than a flat changelog.

*Provenance* — most code in this repo lives downstream of P4-SpecTec, so each change should record where it came from and how much was adapted. This is what backs the `Original-commit:` trailer, the Port vs. Sync PR distinction, and the `Adapted` / `Omitted` scope buckets. With provenance preserved, comparing against upstream or another SpecTec variant remains a tractable git operation rather than archeology.

When a rule below feels arbitrary, it's usually one of these three showing through.

## Commits

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) with one project-specific type:

```
type(scope): imperative summary

<motivation: one or two sentences on the prior problem>

<solution: what the change makes true now>
```

Standard types apply (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `perf`, `style`). Plus:

- **`spec`** — changes to `.spectec` files. *All other commits are assumed to be OCaml changes* under the appropriate standard type. A spec rule update is `spec(...)`; a change to the elaborator that consumes it is `refactor(elaborate): ...`.
- **`reorg`** — directory renames, file moves, or layout-only changes that don't restructure code or alter behavior. Distinct from `refactor` (changes code structure) and `chore` (build config or deps). When a rename forces caller updates, the change stays `reorg` if the caller updates are mechanical path/identifier swaps; promote to `refactor` when the rename motivates a real API or structure change.

  The type exists because behavior preservation is a useful property to advertise — tools and reviewers can act differently when they know a change is layout-only. Reviewers seeing `reorg:` skip semantic review and focus on the mechanical check ("did all references update? did anything break the build?"). `git bisect skip $(git log --grep "^reorg" bad..good --format=%H)` removes layout noise from regression bisects. Cherry-picks and reverts are mechanical (paths or identifiers) rather than requiring behavioral analysis.

  Examples: renaming a directory, splitting a corpus into subdirectories, consolidating duplicated test data.

Scope is the narrowest area that honestly describes the change: `cli`, `elaborate`, `il`, `interp`, `instrumentation`, `mixop`, `lang`, `targets/p4`, etc.

### Subject

The subject is **imperative**, present-tense — `extract error handling`, not `extracted` or `extracts`. It names a *concept*, not specific code. Identifiers belong in the body.

- Good: `refactor(cli): extract error handling and group shared flags by role`
- Avoid: `refactor(cli): extract guard from subcommand.ml and group flags into Output/Spec/Batch/Checkpoint`

### Body

The body answers **why** (motivation: what was wrong or limiting) and **what** (solution: the shape the code is in now). The **how** is in the diff — do not restate it in prose.

Two parts, distinguished by **tense**:

- **Motivation** — describes the prior state, one or two sentences. Past tense (`The diagnostic helper lived inline in subcommand.ml, duplicated across multiple consumers.`) or a `Currently, …` framing (`Currently, errors and warnings print immediately when encountered.`); past tense is the default and preferred form.
- **Solution** — third-person present, reading as if narrating what *this commit* does (`The helper is extracted to error_handling.ml…`, `Adds…`, `Replaces…`, `Updates…`). Avoid first-person (`We extract…`) and avoid future tense (`Will extract…`). Bullets follow the same voice.

The motivation paragraph is **optional when the motivation is self-evident from the subject** — adding tests, syncing with upstream, a one-line typo fix. Where it earns its keep is `fix` and `refactor` commits: both must justify themselves against the prior state, so a short past-tense sentence on what was wrong or what was limiting is almost always worth writing.

Name actual identifiers in the body — modules, functions, flags. Plain English is for framing; identifiers are for specifics.

Bullets only when the change spans distinct scopes that don't flow as prose. A single-scope commit gets a prose paragraph.

**ASCII only.** Commit messages flow through varied consumers (`git log`, `gh`, CI logs, `git send-email`, changelog generators), not all of which render UTF-8 reliably. Prefer `->` over `→`. Avoid em-dashes (`—`) entirely rather than substituting `--`; restructure with commas, parens, or periods instead. PR bodies render as Markdown and are fair game for typography; commit messages aren't.

### Trailers

One trailer carries provenance:

- `Original-commit:` — the upstream or sibling-repo commit this change is based on, regardless of how literal or adapted. May appear multiple times when one local commit consolidates a chain of upstream changes. The prose body carries the *degree* of adaptation: a one-line "Ported from P4-SpecTec." signals a direct port; a paragraph explaining what was kept and changed signals an adaptation.

When attributing to upstream in prose, write **"Ported from P4-SpecTec."** as its own paragraph between the solution prose and the trailer block. It pairs visually with `Original-commit:` to form a provenance stanza, separate from the motivation and solution above:

```
<motivation paragraph>

<solution paragraph and/or bullets>

Ported from P4-SpecTec.

Original-commit: https://github.com/kaist-plrg/p4-spectec/commit/<sha>
```

A second trailer, `Copied-from:`, is used for literal tree imports (e.g. dropping in a fresh upstream `spec/` directory) rather than commit ports.

**Use the full GitHub URL in commit-message trailers**, not the `org/repo@sha` shorthand:

```
Original-commit: https://github.com/kaist-plrg/p4-spectec/commit/3e806c83fc38
```

The shorthand (`kaist-plrg/p4-spectec@3e806c83fc38`) renders nicely on GitHub but is opaque in `git log` and unclickable in plain terminals. Reserve it for **PR bodies and merge-commit cover letters**, where GitHub's rendering is the primary read path.

### Atomicity

Each commit must build on its own. Split work as far as possible *without* introducing placeholders or scaffolding solely to satisfy the rule. If keeping a commit buildable would require dead code, fold it into the next.

### Worked examples

A refactor, from [`388d6b3d`](https://github.com/kaist-plrg/spectec-core/commit/388d6b3d):

> `refactor(cli): extract error handling and group shared flags by role`
>
> The diagnostic helper lived inline in `subcommand.ml`, duplicated across multiple consumers. Shared flag definitions sat at the top of `cli_args.ml` with no organization.
>
> The helper is extracted to `error_handling.ml` as `guard`/`guard_unit`, called from both `subcommand.ml` and `bin/main.ml`. Shared CLI flags are grouped into `Output`, `Spec`, `Batch`, `Checkpoint` and `Interpreter` submodules. Checkpoint flags become a composite record since they always appear together; the rest stay individual for now.

A feature, from [`39f18ac1`](https://github.com/kaist-plrg/spectec-core/commit/39f18ac1):

> `feat(diagnostic): scaffolding for comprehensive diagnostics`
>
> Currently, errors and warnings print immediately when encountered.
>
> To improve diagnostic structure and error messages, as well as support LSPs in the future, a new global `Diagnostic` type is added, with basic scaffolding such as constructors and collectors.

Both follow the same shape: a past-tense framing sentence, then a present-tense paragraph narrating what the commit does.

## Rebasing

A messy WIP branch becomes a reviewable history through interactive rebase. The atomicity rule above defines the *target shape*; this section is *how to get there*.

### Folding WIP into atomic commits

```bash
git rebase -i <base>
```

Use `fixup` and `squash` to absorb follow-ups into the commit they belong to. The criterion is the per-commit buildability rule: if combining produces the smallest commit that still builds and tells one coherent story, fold.

Rewrite messages during the rebase, not before — the final subject and body describe the *folded* result, not any intermediate state.

When folding port commits, use `squash` rather than `fixup` so that `Original-commit:` trailers from the absorbed commits survive into the rewritten message — `fixup` discards messages, including trailers. Consolidate all surviving trailers in the rewritten message; one local commit may carry multiple `Original-commit:` lines.

### Verifying buildability

Don't trust the invariant; enforce it:

```bash
git rebase -i --exec 'make exe' <base>
# or, slower but stronger:
git rebase -i --exec 'make test-quick' <base>
```

The rebase stops on the first commit that fails. Fix or fold and continue.

### `.expected` files during rebase

`.expected` files are generated output, not source. When a rebase conflict lands inside one, **do not hand-merge the diff** — regenerate it. Roughly:

1. Resolve any non-`.expected` conflicts and ensure `make exe` succeeds.
2. `make promote` to regenerate the affected `.expected` files from current code.
3. `git add` the regenerated files and `git rebase --continue`.

If a commit shifts output and a later commit depends on the new expected state, mid-rebase regeneration is the only correct resolution. Hand-merging silently bakes stale expectations into the history.

### Authoring messages during the rebase

When the rebase pauses on a `reword` or `squash`, the commit-message conventions above apply — the rebase is when messages get rewritten, not just when commits get reordered.

## Direct commits to main

The default is that every change lands through a PR. Two narrow categories may be pushed directly to `main`:

- **Documentation-only changes** — `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, in-tree docs. No code, no expectations shifted.
- **Trivial project-wide fixes** with no semantic content — e.g. a missing `dune` dependency, a typo in a build flag, a dead import. The bar is that a reviewer's only useful response would be "yes, obviously."

Anything that touches behavior, output, or the spec goes through a PR even when small. When in doubt, open the PR — the cost of a one-line PR is low; the cost of a direct commit that turned out to need discussion is a revert.

The commit-message conventions above still apply: a direct-to-main commit isn't an excuse for a terse subject and no body.

## Pull Requests

PRs fall into five shapes. The shape determines title prefix and body structure:

| Type     | Title                          | Body skeleton                                                                |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Refactor | `Refactor <concept>`           | `## Motivation` → optional `## Core Concept(s)` → optional `## Scope` → `## Commit Log` |
| Feature  | concept-led, no prefix         | `## Motivation` → `## Core Concept(s)` → optional `## Scope` → `## Commit Log` |
| Port     | concept-led, no prefix         | `## Motivation` (cite original PR) → `## Scope` (Ported / Adapted / Omitted) → `## Commit Log` |
| Sync     | `Sync <area>`                  | `## Motivation` → `## Scope` (Ported / Adapted / Local Changes) → `## Commit Log` |
| Reorg    | `Reorg <concept>`              | `## Motivation` → optional `## Scope` (rename list) → `## Commit Log` |

`## Future Work` is optional on any type for deferred follow-ups and open design questions. `## Minor Changes` holds commits that ship in the PR but don't fit the main story.

The Port/Sync distinction is intentional: a **Port** tracks one upstream PR end-to-end and contains only the adaptations needed to land it locally; a **Sync** is a catch-up that may bundle several upstream commits *and* genuinely local fixes or features. The two share vocabulary but differ in what each is allowed to bundle.

**Reorgs** typically fast-forward (single-commit) and use `## Scope` to list the moves explicitly. Behavior preservation is the implicit precondition — if the change has any semantic shift, it's a Refactor.

### Title

One clean angle, not a two-sided story. If you reach for `X and Y`, ask whether the two halves are one concept under a better name.

- One concept: [`#34 Refactor CLI into per-target modules`](https://github.com/kaist-plrg/spectec-core/pull/34) — clearer than `Refactor CLI to define subcommand interfaces and consolidate target modules`, even though the diff does both.
- Two genuinely independent threads, joined explicitly: [`#32 Refactor instrumentation architecture and make lifecycle exception-safe`](https://github.com/kaist-plrg/spectec-core/pull/32).

`Refactor`, `Sync`, and `Reorg` lead with the verb. Features and Ports lead with the concept directly ([`#30 Simplify elaboration using IL types`](https://github.com/kaist-plrg/spectec-core/pull/30)) — the verb prefix is dropped because the concept already names the change.

When themes mix, pick the dominant one for the title and let off-arc commits live under `## Minor Changes` in the body. Avoid abstract nouns like `composition` or `orchestration` in the title; reserve those for the body where they have room to be defined.

### Body

Open every PR with `## Motivation` — the problem, pressure, or design goal. The remaining sections depend on the type.

**Refactors and Features** share the skeleton shown in the table above, with optional `## Scope` and `## Future Work` when the change needs more explanation. The criterion for adding `## Scope` mirrors the criterion for bullets in a commit message: the concept is coherent at the top level, but it touches enough distinct scopes that prose alone leaves the reader without a map. A small refactor in one module needs `Motivation` and `Commit Log` only; a cross-cutting one needs the scoped breakdown.

`## Core Concept(s)` typically lists ideas as bolded bullets and closes with one paragraph naming the direction the PR moves the code in. The bullets are the *what*; the closing paragraph is *why this hangs together*. Drop it when the motivation already names the concept clearly.

**Ports and Syncs** share a vocabulary for what comes from upstream:

- `### Ported` — upstream commits taken nearly directly.
- `### Adapted` — upstream commits whose intent is preserved but whose code was adjusted for the local context.
- `### Omitted` — upstream commits explicitly not taken, with a one-line reason.

`### Omitted` is mainly used in Ports, where one-to-one upstream tracking makes the gap worth noting. Bullets in all three sections cite their origin: `Original: kaist-plrg/p4-spectec@<sha>`.

The two types diverge in one bucket: **only Syncs allow `### Local Changes`**, capturing local-origin fixes or features that ride along with the catch-up. A Port that wants to include a local fix should split the fix into its own commit landing through a separate PR — Ports stay one-to-one with their upstream PR. Ports also expect the Motivation to link the upstream PR being tracked.

Scoped bullets summarize **thematically**, not one-per-commit. Group commits serving the same idea under one bullet — five commits often collapse to two or three. The per-commit view is preserved by `## Commit Log`; scope bullets give the reader the *shape*.

End multi-commit PRs with `## Commit Log` listing commit subjects verbatim — including their `type(scope):` prefixes — in final-history order. GitHub's `is:pr` search matches title and body only, not commit subjects, so inlining them keeps the PR discoverable.

The body is prose-first. Bullets enumerate concrete changes or scope boundaries — they aren't the default format for the whole PR. Within the body, GitHub shorthand for cross-repo references (`org/repo@sha`, `org/repo#NN`) is preferred over full URLs since GitHub renders them inline.

### Opening a PR

```bash
git push -u origin <branch>
gh pr create --title "<title>" --body-file <body.md>
```

Drafting the body in a file produces cleaner prose than typing it into the `gh` flag.

### Worked examples

- **Refactor:** [#34 — Refactor CLI into per-target modules](https://github.com/kaist-plrg/spectec-core/pull/34): scoped refactor with `Core Concepts` + `Scope` and an off-arc `feat(cli)` bullet under `Minor Changes`.
- **Refactor (two-threaded):** [#32 — Refactor instrumentation architecture and make lifecycle exception-safe](https://github.com/kaist-plrg/spectec-core/pull/32): legitimate two-threaded title; the cover letter splits the threads in the scope bullets.
- **Port:** [#30 — Simplify elaboration using IL types](https://github.com/kaist-plrg/spectec-core/pull/30): concept-led title (no `Refactor` prefix) tracking one upstream PR, with `Scope` split into `Ported` / `Adapted` / `Omitted`.
- **Sync:** [#35 — Sync new P4 concrete spec](https://github.com/kaist-plrg/spectec-core/pull/35): catch-up bundling upstream ports with local changes, with `Scope` split into `Ported` / `Adapted` / `Local Changes`.

When unsure, run `git log --merges` and find the most recent merge whose shape matches yours. (Single-commit ff-merged PRs — see below — won't appear in `--merges`; scan `git log` directly for those.)

## Merge Commits

Merge commits are *cover letters*, not rewritten commit logs. Their reader is scanning `git log` to answer "what landed, where, and what's deferred" without opening individual commits or PRs. Structure follows that role: one framing paragraph summarizing the branch-level outcome, then scoped bullets only when they make the cover letter quicker to parse than prose alone.

Subject: `Merge: <lowercase summary> (#PR)`. The summary mirrors the PR title (lowercased) so a reader scanning `git log` sees consistent phrasing on both sides.

Avoid one-bullet-per-commit. Prefer scoped summaries (`refactor(instrumentation): ...`, `fix(interp): ...`) describing the merged result. Apply the same thematic grouping as `## Scope`: a six-commit branch may merit only three or four scoped bullets.

Off-arc commits (the `## Minor Changes` of the PR body) get their own bullet at the end of the scoped block in their original `feat(...)` / `fix(...)` form, so the reader sees them as distinct from the refactor arc.

```bash
git checkout main && git pull
git merge --no-ff <branch>      # editor opens; write the cover letter
git push origin main
```

Squash merges are never used: they discard the per-commit history that the rest of this guide is built around. Fast-forward merges are reserved for the single-commit-PR exception below.

### Scoped sections

A single thematic bullet list needs no header; bullets sit directly under the framing paragraph. Use section headers only when the cover letter benefits from peer grouping. A Port or Sync may lift its `### Ported / ### Adapted / ### Omitted / ### Local Changes` distinctions to peer sections (`Ported:`, `Adapted:`, …) instead of mixing them inside one bullet list. Mixing `PORTED:`, `ADAPTED:`, `OMITTED:` prefixes inside a single list makes the cover letter obscure: a reader has to disambiguate every bullet by prefix instead of skimming uniform peer lists.

Bullets, whether in a peer section or as a single list, take the form `type(scope): Description.` (matching the corresponding commit subject's prefix). Optional `Original: <ref>` suffix when citing upstream provenance, in the same form the PR body uses (full URL, GitHub shorthand, bare SHA, or absent).

### Deferred items

Deferred items appear as a bullet group with a `DEFERRED:` prefix per bullet and no section header:

```
- DEFERRED: <description>.
- DEFERRED: <description>.
```

The prefix is the signal: `git log --grep "DEFERRED:"` collects backlogs scattered across history. A wrapping section header would only repeat that signal, so it is omitted.

### Single-commit PRs (exception)

The default above — `--no-ff`, cover letter, no squash — assumes a multi-commit PR whose internal structure deserves preservation. Large refactors invert this: splitting a sweeping rename or cross-cutting restructure into many atomic commits produces intermediate states that don't individually clarify the change, and the reviewer ends up reading the diff as a whole anyway. For these, a **single-commit PR** is allowed, and is **fast-forwarded** onto main.

Fast-forward, not squash: the branch is already one commit, so merging just advances `main`. No merge commit is created, and the commit's SHA is preserved across the merge.

Because there is no merge commit, the lone commit's message *is* the cover letter. It must carry the framing a `Merge:` subject and body would otherwise provide — motivation, the shape of the result, and (if relevant) scope bullets — under the normal `type(scope):` subject. The PR body still follows the Pull Requests conventions above; ff-merging does not skip the PR.

```bash
git checkout main && git pull
git merge --ff-only <branch>
git push origin main
```

`--ff-only` makes the merge fail loudly if the branch isn't actually one commit ahead of `main`, rather than silently creating a merge commit. If it fails, rebase the branch onto `main` first.

This exception is for refactors whose atomicity would be artificial. A feature, fix, or port stays multi-commit and `--no-ff`.
