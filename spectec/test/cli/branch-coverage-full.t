impty CLI: branch-coverage full against hello.imp.

  $ SPEC=../../specs/impty/base/spec.spectec
  $ HELLO=../../testdata/interp/impty/base/hello.imp

Full branch coverage emits every relation and function with coverage
annotations, not just the uncovered ones:

  $ spectec impty eval --spec $SPEC -p $HELLO --color never --branch-coverage.level full
